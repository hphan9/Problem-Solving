/* Happy number _ Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not. */
```class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
       
    int sum =0;
     do{ 
         sum=0;
        do{
    sum += pow((n%10), 2);
     n/=10;
           
        }while(n>0);
        n=sum;
          
     }while(!(n/10 == 0));
        
        if(n==1 || n== 7){
        return true;}
        else{
            return false;
